# Ladder Lessons GitHub Pages Deployment Report

## Overview

This report details the steps taken to successfully deploy the Ladder Lessons React + Vite project to GitHub Pages under the `/ladder-lessons/` subfolder path. The primary goal was to ensure all resources and routes function correctly after deployment.

## Issues Encountered and Solutions

Initially, the deployment faced issues with asset loading due to incorrect path configurations in `vite.config.js` and `index.html`. Several iterations were required to identify the root cause and implement the correct solution.

### Initial Attempts and Challenges

1.  **Absolute Paths in `vite.config.js` and `index.html`**: Attempts to set `base: 
'/ladder-lessons/'` in `vite.config.js` and corresponding absolute paths in `index.html` (e.g., `/ladder-lessons/favicon.ico`) resulted in build failures, specifically `Error: Failed to resolve /ladder-lessons/assets/index-BytJd5Jl.js from /home/ubuntu/ladder-lessons/frontend/index.html`.

2.  **`spa-github-pages` Script**: The presence of the `spa-github-pages` script in `index.html` was also considered a potential conflict, as it handles client-side routing for GitHub Pages. Removing this script was attempted in conjunction with various path configurations.

3.  **`outDir` Configuration**: Changing `outDir` to `../docs` in `vite.config.js` was explored as a potential solution, but it did not resolve the asset loading issues during the build process.

### Final Solution

The successful deployment was achieved by reverting to a simpler, more robust configuration:

1.  **`vite.config.js`**: The `base` property in `vite.config.js` was set to a relative path: `base: './'`. This ensures that Vite generates relative paths for all assets during the build process.

2.  **`index.html`**: The `spa-github-pages` script was completely removed from `index.html`. All asset references (e.g., `favicon.ico`, `index-BytJd5Jl.js`, `index-BEmw6Uh3.css`) were updated to use relative paths (e.g., `./favicon.ico`, `./assets/index-BytJd5Jl.js`).

This combination allowed Vite to correctly build the application with relative asset paths, which are then correctly resolved by GitHub Pages when served from a subfolder.

## Deployment Process

1.  **Configuration Update**: Modified `frontend/vite.config.js` to set `base: './'` and `frontend/index.html` to remove the `spa-github-pages` script and use relative paths for assets.
2.  **Rebuild**: Executed `pnpm run build` in the `frontend` directory to generate the static assets.
3.  **Git Operations**: Staged the changes (`git add .`), committed them (`git commit -m 


"Fix: Revert Vite config to relative base and remove spa-github-pages script from index.html"`), and pushed to GitHub (`git push HEAD:main`).
4.  **GitHub Actions Monitoring**: Monitored the GitHub Actions workflow to ensure the deployment process completed successfully.
5.  **UAT Testing**: Performed User Acceptance Testing (UAT) by navigating to `https://sharichung.github.io/ladder-lessons/` and verifying that all pages loaded correctly, routes transitioned as expected, and all interactive features functioned as intended.

## Deployment Result

The Ladder Lessons website has been successfully deployed to GitHub Pages and is accessible at: `https://sharichung.github.io/ladder-lessons/`.

All pages load correctly, routing works as expected, and all resources and interactive features are fully functional.

## Conclusion

This deployment demonstrates a robust solution for deploying Vite-based React applications to GitHub Pages subfolders. The key was to leverage Vite's relative path handling and ensure `index.html` also uses relative paths, avoiding conflicts with GitHub Pages' serving mechanism.
